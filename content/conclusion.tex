\section{Conclusion}
This thesis has improved and added more features to the \gls{cmb} system. The features are mainly usability features whith a focus on efficiency, learnability, and satisfiability. As usability is a broad term and there always is room for usability improvements in a software system, only a sub-set of the usability improvements listed in Appendix \ref{apdx:backlog} and urgent usability aspects discovered throughout this Spring have been implemented. \\

Features implemented into the frontend, server, and backend code have been described in detail. Real-time notifications with Socket.io was integrated into the system to enable automatic state updates of submissions.  Further use cases of Socket.io and implementation suggestions of these features has briefly been presented. The potential of Socket.io in the system is huge and enables future developers to implement interesting features. \\

Further, solutions to bugs such as enabling uploads for Mac OS X users and cancel submissions that locks the backend have been described. The frontend views have also had some renovation, such as removal unnecessary information, gathering equal functionality, and updating components with symbols. The improvements aims to make it easier for users find important information, to navigate easier, and to more clearly state the outcome of interacting with system components.

Feedback messages presented to users has also changed in system version two. Users are now presented with colored feedback messages when interacting with the system to make it easier to differentiate between feedback. Submission errors are also displayed in a pop-up message instead of in a designated view, which removes unnecessary navigation stages. A spinner and real-time updates of state when running submissions is also implemented in the system. \\

Automatic conversion to Unix file type when uploading problem specific files to the server has been added to the administrator interface. Easier deletion of submissions from the database and file system has also been added to the administrator interface. The \gls{dbms} used has also been switched from SQLite to MySQL, and all previous data present at the development and production server of \gls{cmb} have successfully been moved into the new databases. \\

An user experiment have been conducted to evaluate system usability. The user experiment compared version one developed by Follan and Støa, with system version two developed in this thesis. The results shows that users are, by a 97.2\% probability, more satisfied with feedback given in system version two. There is also a noticeable trend that users are more satisfied with the design and HowTo-page of system version two, and we would need to almost double the amount of participants in both user studies to be 80\% certain that both the design and HowTo-page also has improved. Improvements not tested as part of the user experiment, has been covered continuous user testing conducted throughout the semester. \\

In conclusion, this project has contributed towards improving system usability and features of the \gls{cmb} system. It has also contributed with proposals on features and implementation details for the future development of the system. The contributions made are valuable for the future of the \gls{cmb} system and project as a whole.


\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future-work}
This section will describe possible future extensions which can be made to the system and the project in general. Each extension will be ordered by a suggested order of priority, and are marked either as A(High), B(medium), or C(low).

\subsection*{Project Workflow}

\paragraph*{A. Project descriptions should follow ACM ICPC standards:} As mentioned in Sub-\Cref{sub-sec:prop-problems}, problem descriptions should be in the same format as problem descriptions presented bu other \glspl{oj}. Follan and Støa also mentioned best practices when adding new problems to the system, and they should be followed by future administrators. Best practices and a manual for adding problems can be found in Appendix \ref{apdx:problems}.

\paragraph*{B. Thorough testing of added problems:} Problems descriptions should be thoroughly tested on the development server of \gls{cmb} before adding the problem to the production server. This means that the input and output files of a problem to be added should be heavily tested to make sure it covers all edge cases present in the problem description. During the semester.

\subsection*{Development Workflow}


\subsection*{New Features and Code Extensions}
More sophisticated testing of submissions, multiple tests.

Should check the uploaded zip file structure before storing the files.

Boilerplate checkers to be provided through the admin interface.

Time limit per problem language.

Server timers (for timeout reporting timeouts to the frontend) and execution time estimation.

Updated queue on server, should report submissions index in queue over socketio upon enqueues and dequeues.

Port bash scripts to Python scripts, easier to write (unit-)tests and should be less error prone upon code changes.

Add database test fixtures for future programmers!

Compile threads and cross compiler to restrict inline assembly code.
