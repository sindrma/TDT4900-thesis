\section{Conclusion}

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future-work}

More sophisticated testing of submissions, multiple tests.

Should check the uploaded zip file structure before storing the files.

Boilerplate checkers to be provided through the admin interface.

Time limit per problem language.

Server timers (for timeout reporting timeouts to the frontend) and execution time estimation.

Updated queue on server, should report submissions index in queue over socketio upon enqueues and dequeues.

Port bash scripts to Python scripts, easier to write (unit-)tests and should be less error prone upon code changes.

Add database test fixtures for future programmers!

More thorough testing of problems on climb dev before they are added to prod. Develop test cases of both failing and accepted programs.

Compile threads and cross compiler to restrict inline assembly code.
