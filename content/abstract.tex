For each new smartphone model release, the limits of their CPUs, so called heterogenous multicore processors, are pushed. As a result, the usage of such processors has gained increased interest outside the mobile market and they are now candidates for building energy efficient supercomputer architectures. The European Mont-Blanc project aims to develop a high-performant supercomputer system, using smartphone processors, to lower energy consumption 15 to 30 times compared to other high-performance supercomputers. The project has already constructed multiple prototypes by using heterogenous processors, and has shown promising results for future development of energy efficient supercomputer architectures. \\

Energy consumption of smartphones are increasing as they are becoming more computationally powerful. Regarding energy efficiency, there are enormous challenges ahead for both hardware and sofware developers. Noticing the need for training programmers in energy efficient programming and hopefully solve some of the challenges, Lasse Natvig started the Climbing Mont Blanc project. Inspired by other Online Judge systems, the idea is to let programmers compete to develop energy efficient code to programming problems offered by the system.
