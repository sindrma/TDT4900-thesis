    abstract = {In the late 1990s, powerful economic forces led to the adoption of commodity desktop processors in high-performance computing. This transformation has been so effective that the June 2013 TOP500 list is still dominated by x86.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn 2013, the largest commodity market in computing is not PCs or servers, but mobile computing, comprising smart-phones and tablets, most of which are built with ARM-based SoCs. This leads to the suggestion that once mobile SoCs deliver sufficient performance, mobile SoCs can help reduce the cost of HPC.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis paper addresses this question in detail. We analyze the trend in mobile SoC performance, comparing it with the similar trend in the 1990s. We also present our experience evaluating performance and efficiency of mobile SoCs, deploying a cluster and evaluating the network and scalability of production applications. In summary, we give a first answer as to whether mobile SoCs are ready for HPC.},

    abstract = {It is widely accepted that future HPC systems will be limited by their power consumption. Current HPC systems are built from commodity server processors, designed over years to achieve maximum performance, with energy efficiency being an after-thought. In this paper we advocate a different approach: building HPC systems from low-power embedded and mobile technology parts, over time designed for maximum energy efficiency, which now show promise for competitive performance. We introduce the architecture of Tibidabo, the first large-scale HPC cluster built from ARM multicore chips, and a detailed performance and energy efficiency evaluation. We present the lessons learned for the design and improvement in energy efficiency of future HPC systems based on such low-power cores. Based on our experience with the prototype, we perform simulations to show that a theoretical cluster of 16-core ARM Cortex-A15 chips would increase the energy efficiency of our cluster by 8.7??, reaching an energy efficiency of 1046??MFLOPS/W. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The modern Web$\backslash$narchitecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions,$\backslash$ngenerality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and$\backslash$nintermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security,$\backslash$nand encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State$\backslash$nTransfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of$\backslash$nthe Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the$\backslash$nHypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We$\backslash$ndescribe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the$\backslash$ninteraction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting$\backslash$nthem to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare$\backslash$nthe abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order$\backslash$nto elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications$\backslash$nthey are intended to support},
