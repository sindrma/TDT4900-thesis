    abstract = {In the late 1990s, powerful economic forces led to the adoption of commodity desktop processors in high-performance computing. This transformation has been so effective that the June 2013 TOP500 list is still dominated by x86.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn 2013, the largest commodity market in computing is not PCs or servers, but mobile computing, comprising smart-phones and tablets, most of which are built with ARM-based SoCs. This leads to the suggestion that once mobile SoCs deliver sufficient performance, mobile SoCs can help reduce the cost of HPC.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis paper addresses this question in detail. We analyze the trend in mobile SoC performance, comparing it with the similar trend in the 1990s. We also present our experience evaluating performance and efficiency of mobile SoCs, deploying a cluster and evaluating the network and scalability of production applications. In summary, we give a first answer as to whether mobile SoCs are ready for HPC.},

    abstract = {It is widely accepted that future HPC systems will be limited by their power consumption. Current HPC systems are built from commodity server processors, designed over years to achieve maximum performance, with energy efficiency being an after-thought. In this paper we advocate a different approach: building HPC systems from low-power embedded and mobile technology parts, over time designed for maximum energy efficiency, which now show promise for competitive performance. We introduce the architecture of Tibidabo, the first large-scale HPC cluster built from ARM multicore chips, and a detailed performance and energy efficiency evaluation. We present the lessons learned for the design and improvement in energy efficiency of future HPC systems based on such low-power cores. Based on our experience with the prototype, we perform simulations to show that a theoretical cluster of 16-core ARM Cortex-A15 chips would increase the energy efficiency of our cluster by 8.7??, reaching an energy efficiency of 1046??MFLOPS/W. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

    abstract={Latest generations of microprocessors target to maximize energy efficiency over other constraints such as area or performance. This turn of events does not only affect the industry, the academia is also focusing it's efforts in proposing new solutions to maximize energy efficiency of computations at all levels, from hardware to software. While voltage, frequency and activity factors are usually considered by researchers in their works, temperature is usually left aside in their calculations or models. In this work we present an evaluation of the effects of temperature in real hardware taking advantage of the relatively new hardware energy counters available since the second generation of Intel® Core™ processors. Results show an average 5% energy increase with every 8-10 degrees Celsius increment. After certaint temperature (80-100C), the processor starts throttling it's frequency to prevent permanent damage on the die. Based on these results we will discuss some “good practices” when evaluating power and energy based on on-chip energy measurements.},

abstract = {Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. This article is a quick overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and its current usage.},
