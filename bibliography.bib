    abstract = {In the late 1990s, powerful economic forces led to the adoption of commodity desktop processors in high-performance computing. This transformation has been so effective that the June 2013 TOP500 list is still dominated by x86.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn 2013, the largest commodity market in computing is not PCs or servers, but mobile computing, comprising smart-phones and tablets, most of which are built with ARM-based SoCs. This leads to the suggestion that once mobile SoCs deliver sufficient performance, mobile SoCs can help reduce the cost of HPC.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis paper addresses this question in detail. We analyze the trend in mobile SoC performance, comparing it with the similar trend in the 1990s. We also present our experience evaluating performance and efficiency of mobile SoCs, deploying a cluster and evaluating the network and scalability of production applications. In summary, we give a first answer as to whether mobile SoCs are ready for HPC.},

    abstract = {It is widely accepted that future HPC systems will be limited by their power consumption. Current HPC systems are built from commodity server processors, designed over years to achieve maximum performance, with energy efficiency being an after-thought. In this paper we advocate a different approach: building HPC systems from low-power embedded and mobile technology parts, over time designed for maximum energy efficiency, which now show promise for competitive performance. We introduce the architecture of Tibidabo, the first large-scale HPC cluster built from ARM multicore chips, and a detailed performance and energy efficiency evaluation. We present the lessons learned for the design and improvement in energy efficiency of future HPC systems based on such low-power cores. Based on our experience with the prototype, we perform simulations to show that a theoretical cluster of 16-core ARM Cortex-A15 chips would increase the energy efficiency of our cluster by 8.7??, reaching an energy efficiency of 1046??MFLOPS/W. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This turn of events does not only affect the industry, the academia is also focusing it's efforts in proposing new solutions to maximize energy efficiency of computations at all levels, from hardware to software. While voltage, frequency and activity factors are usually considered by researchers in their works, temperature is usually left aside in their calculations or models. In this work we present an evaluation of the effects of temperature in real hardware taking advantage of the relatively new hardware energy counters available since the second generation of Intel® Core™ processors. Results show an average 5% energy increase with every 8-10 degrees Celsius increment. After certaint temperature (80-100C), the processor starts throttling it's frequency to prevent permanent damage on the die. Based on these results we will discuss some “good practices” when evaluating power and energy based on on-chip energy measurements.},

    abstract = {Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application-a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on CD, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable components. The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on CD-ROM. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.},

@article{a:edp,
    abstract = {Introduction Recently there has been a surge of interest in low-power devices and design techniques. While many papers have been published describing power-saving techniques for use in digital systems, trade-offs between the methods are rarely discussed. We address this issue by using an energy-delay metric to compare many of the proposed techniques. Using this metric also provides insight into some of the basic trade-offs in low-power design. The next section describes the energy-loss mechanisms that are present in CMOS circuits, which provides the parameters that must be changed to lower the power dissipation. With these factors in mind, the rest of the paper reviews the energy saving techniques that have been proposed. These proposals fall into one of three main strategies: trade speed for power, don't waste power, and find a lower power problem. CMOS Power Dissipation Power dissipation in CMOS circuits arises from two different mechanisms: static power, which results from resistive paths from the power supply to ground, and dynamic power, which results from switching capacitive loads between two different voltage states. Dynamic power is frequency dependent, since no power is dissipated if the node values don't change, while static power is independent of frequency and exists whenever the chip is powered on. For uses where the electronics will be inactive for much of the time (most portable applications), the static power must be made very low in the inactive state.},

Such systems are especially applicable in teaching algorithmic problem solving since they can automatically test if an algorithm has been correctly implemented, i.e., that it performs its specified function on a set of inputs. Being able to implement algorithms that work correctly is a crucial skill for CS students in their professional role, but it can be difficult to convey the importance of this in a classroom situation. Programming and problem solving education supported by automated grading has been used since 2002 at our department. We study, using action research methodology, different strategies for deploying automated assessment systems in CS courses. Towards this end, we have developed an automated assessment system and both introduced it into existing courses and constructed new courses structured around it. Our primary data sources for evaluation consists of course evaluations, statistics on students' submitted solutions, and experience teaching the courses.
